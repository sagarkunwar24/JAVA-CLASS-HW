Q: What is the different between JDK, JRE and JVM?
   A: JDK > JRE >JVM
    
  • JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment 
        in which Java byte code can be executed
        
  •  JRE (Java Runtime Environment) contains JVM supporting libraries, and other components to run a Java program. 
           JRE is the runtime environment which implements JVM and provides all 
         class libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime
 
 • JDK (Java Development Kit) contains JRE and tools such as compilers and debuggers for developing Java applications. 
            JDK is the tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs. 
          The JDK completely includes JRE
