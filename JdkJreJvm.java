Q: What is the different between JDK, JRE and JVM?
   A: JDK > JRE >JVM
   
      • JDK (Java Development Kit) is the tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs. 
          The JDK completely includes JRE
          
     •  JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the runtime environment which implements JVM and provides all 
      class libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime
      
      • JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment 
        in which Java byte code can be executed
